# code-challenge-keola**Project Purpose:**

The project aims to develop an order management application for an e-commerce system, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete orders. Users can browse products and add them to a cart, but must register or log in to complete purchases. Order details will include customer information and a product list, with products and customers stored in relational databases, while orders will be kept in a non-relational database. A back-office will facilitate product management within the CRM, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
